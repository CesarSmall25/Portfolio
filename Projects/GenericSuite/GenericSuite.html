						<h3>Who am I?</h3>
						<p>I’m a gameplay and UI programmer with several years of experience working in Unreal Engine using both C++ and Blueprints. My work focuses on building scalable, modular systems with a strong emphasis on maintainability, performance, and multiplayer correctness. 
							I’ve designed and implemented a wide range of systems including inventory and economy, interaction and building mechanics, UI navigation, and online multiplayer workflows. I place a high value on clean architecture, data driven design, and creating solutions that can be reused across projects rather than tightly coupled to a single game.
							
							<br><br> I have professional experience working within team environments, including leading UI development, and I am also comfortable taking ownership of systems end to end when working independently. 
								I approach development with a long term mindset, prioritizing clarity, extensibility, and polish throughout the production lifecycle.
						
							<br><br> I’m motivated by building reliable tools and gameplay systems that developers can trust and that players never have to think about. I value iteration, honest feedback, and continuous improvement, and I’m always looking to refine both my technical and creative approach to game development.

								<h3>In My Spare Time</h3>
								<p>Right now I'm into electrical work. I've been tinkering lately with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis trying to learn more about that side of software engineering/IT work. 
									<br><br>If I'm not tinkering with those I'm either playing games (as to be expected), swimming or spending time with friends/family or researching something to improve my development skillset.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>My Aspirations</h3>
								<p>While I don't think I'll be the next Notch or anything, I am aiming to hone my skills as well as possible to become as good of a developer that I can and I hope to one day be able to proudly say that I'm either part of or have developed something with great meaning to a lot of people.
									<br><br> I simply want to be able to have a positive impact on the world through my work, no matter how big or small that impact may be.
